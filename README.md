# Lempe-Brendan-Work
This repository will be used to help me catalog my work and allow others to see what I've been doing. Due to my lacking Github proficiency this page will likely be bare-bones for a while. My work within the Collegeville community largely revolves around writing for the Exascale Computing Project. Currently I'm working on a few Wikipedia articles and doing research to more familiarize myself with this field. Please check the "Wiki" section of this repository if you're interested in what I'm doing/have done. Each page is organized by date, so everything should be easy to find. I also have something going over to the Collegeville/WikiScribe "Projects" tab that can more easily convey my current progress.

Currently the Performance Portability article and the ECP article are on Wikipedia. The Performance Portability article has been approved, but it can still be touched up. The ECP article hasn't been accepted due to a lack of "secondary independent sources to establish notability." If that issue can be fixed the article may be eligible for resubmission and hopefully approval.
